# SS-Admin-Dashboard Project

This project is an administrative dashboard designed to demonstrate proficiency in modern web development frameworks and libraries, specifically Angular, Tailwind CSS, NgRx, and Nx workspace. The dashboard serves as a showcase of the developer's skills, featuring a responsive design, state management, and modular architecture.

## Features

- **Angular**: Utilizes the latest Angular framework for a component-based architecture, ensuring efficient rendering and reusability.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Implements Tailwind CSS for a customizable and low-level utility-first approach, enabling a sleek and modern design.
- **NgRx**: Employs NgRx for state management, providing a single source of truth for the application's state, along with powerful debugging capabilities.
- **Nx Workspace**: Leverages Nx workspace to streamline the development process, allowing for code reusability and better organization across multiple projects.

## Libraries

- **luxon**: is a library for working with dates and times in JavaScript. 
- **ng-icon**: this allows to use icons from heroicons sets with a single icon component
